            You siimply need to insert your card into the slot and wait until it requests for the Personal Identification Number (PIN). After 
                you type your PIN and press enter, it displays options: check balance, withdraw cash, etc. Suppose you want to withdraw cash, press the withdraw button
                Type or  select the amount of money you want to withdraw and then press enter. In a few second it dispenses the cash 
                along with a reeipt. This is amazing, isn't it?
