         <blockquote>In the latitude of central New England, cabbages are not secure from injury from frost with less than a foot of earth thrown over the heads.
             In the mild winters a covering of half that depth will be sufficient; but as we have no peophets to foretell our mild winters, a foot of earth
            is safer than six inches.</blockquote>
