                the appearance of text elements and the boxes they generate. But so far, we've 
                merely been<em> formatting elements</em> as they appear in the flow of the document. 
                In this chapter, we'll look at floating and positioning, the CSS methods 
                for breaking out of the normal flow and arranging elements on the page.
                Floating an element moves it to the left or right and allows the following text 
                to wrap around it. Positioning is a way to specify the location of an element 
                anywhere on the page with pixel precision. Before we start moving elements around, let's be sure we are well acquainted 
                with how they behave in the normal flow. At this point, you've learned dozens of CSS properties that let you change

                First, you'll notice that the style rule that floats the span includes the 
                width property. It is necessary to specify a width for a floated text element 
                because without one, its box is sized wide enough to fit its content (auto). 
                For short phrases that are narrower than the container, that might not be 
                an issue. However, for longer, wrapped text, the box expands to the width 
                of the container, making it so wide that there wouldn't be room to wrap 
                anything around it. It is necessary to specify a width for a floated text element
