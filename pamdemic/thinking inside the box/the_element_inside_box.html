            In the latitude of central New England, cabbages are not secure from injury from frost
            with less than a foot of earth thrown over the heads. In the mild winters a covering of
             half that depth will be sufficient; but as we have no 
           peophets to foretell our mild winters, a foot of earth is safer than six inches.
